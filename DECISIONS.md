## D-82 Blocked is not a column; a held or stopped agent is attention
Amends Spec 15 §1, §2, §3 and §6 (Aaron, 2026-10-08).
1. The default workflow has no `blocked` column. `asked` and `failed` have no target: the task stays in its column (normally `assigned`) and gets `attention`. `unblock` and `review` are allowed in `assigned`, so answering the last question still continues the agent (D-30). A workflow may still name targets for `asked` and `failed`; only `finished` must have one.
2. Attention from a held question (work or investigation), a settings proposal, or a failed or restarted work run carries `hold: true`. It stays through other actions and clears when the run continues (an answer, `unblock`, `investigate`), is restarted (`new_agent`, `start_over`, `reassign`), is stopped, or the task reaches a final column. Any other attention clears on the next action, as before.
3. A task saved in `blocked`, under a workflow without that column, loads in `assigned` with held attention (its own, or "the agent needed an answer or stopped").
4. `blocked` is reserved for a task that depends on another task. Nothing sets it yet and the task has no field for it.
Why: every known case of "blocked" is an agent needing a human, which attention already says; a column for it moved the card away from the work it belongs to.

## D-83 Tests are short and bounded
(Aaron, 2026-10-08.)
1. A test is kept short. A full suite that takes long to run is a defect to fix, not to wait out: a slow test is shortened, or split, when it is found.
2. Every wait in a test (a loop, a join, a poll for a file or a reply) has a deadline and fails with a message when it passes. No test can hang the run.
3. Tests don't share process-wide state: a global such as the task server acts only for the root it serves, so tests running in parallel can't see each other's.
Why: a `tasks::` run timed out because one test's global server made other tests wait forever; the whole run, not just that test, was lost.

## D-84 Agents move files and folders
Amends Spec 14 §3 (Aaron, 2026-10-08).
1. `move <from> <to> [--to-project <folder>]` moves a watched or unwatched file, or a folder, within a project or into another project the task's scope covers (`--project` picks the source's, as for any command). Outside a board run, a move stays in one project.
2. Graph files (a projection of the store), protected files, internal files, `gleam.toml` and symlinks never move, named directly or inside a folder.
3. A move never replaces anything: when something exists at the destination, it is refused (`E6002`) and nothing changes.
4. Atomic: everything is checked before anything changes, and the move is one rename that refuses to replace (`renameat2` with `RENAME_NOREPLACE`). Undo records go first, so a crash after the rename still records the move. A move between file systems is refused, since it can't be one step.
5. Idempotent: repeating a move the session already made, with the source gone and the destination there, changes nothing and says so.
6. The task records each moved file as removed at the source and added at the destination, in each side's project; revert and cancel put it back.
Why: agents had to rewrite a file and remove the original to move it, which loses binary and unwatched files and is not atomic; the human asked for moves within the task's scope that never overwrite.

## D-85 The contract view is its own app
Amends D-62 (Aaron, 2026-10-08).
1. The contract view is its own Gleam project, `solace-cli/contracts` (package `contracts`, JavaScript target), like the migration page. Its component is `<solace-contracts>`, with the optional `base` attribute it had as `<solace-view>`.
2. The shell depends on it by path and registers it. The page is `/contracts`, and `/p/<dir>/contracts` for a workspace project; both render `<solace-contracts>` (with `base` for a project) below the shell's menu bar. `/view` is gone: the server serves the shell at `/contracts`, the board's "Contract view" links and a task's review link (`/contracts?task=<id>`) point there, and an unknown path such as `/view` shows the board. Amends Spec 16's `GET /view`.
3. The menu bar on every page has a **Contracts** link (`/contracts`), marked current on any contract page, including a project's. The menu is 56px high; the contract page fills the rest of the window through `--contracts-height`.
4. The board project holds only the board. The contract view's FFI (`layout.mjs`, its part of `api.mjs`) and the dagre dependency live in `contracts`; the shell keeps dagre because the FFI is copied into its build.
5. Saved browser state keeps its keys (`solace-view-positions:v2:…`, `solace-view-panel-width`), so node positions and the panel width survive the move.
Why: each page is its own app with its own build and tests, as the migration page already is; the tag names the app it belongs to.
