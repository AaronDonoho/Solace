## D-82 Blocked is not a column; a held or stopped agent is attention
Amends Spec 15 §1, §2, §3 and §6 (Aaron, 2026-10-08).
1. The default workflow has no `blocked` column. `asked` and `failed` have no target: the task stays in its column (normally `assigned`) and gets `attention`. `unblock` and `review` are allowed in `assigned`, so answering the last question still continues the agent (D-30). A workflow may still name targets for `asked` and `failed`; only `finished` must have one.
2. Attention from a held question (work or investigation), a settings proposal, or a failed or restarted work run carries `hold: true`. It stays through other actions and clears when the run continues (an answer, `unblock`, `investigate`), is restarted (`new_agent`, `start_over`, `reassign`), is stopped, or the task reaches a final column. Any other attention clears on the next action, as before.
3. A task saved in `blocked`, under a workflow without that column, loads in `assigned` with held attention (its own, or "the agent needed an answer or stopped").
4. `blocked` is reserved for a task that depends on another task. Nothing sets it yet and the task has no field for it.
Why: every known case of "blocked" is an agent needing a human, which attention already says; a column for it moved the card away from the work it belongs to.

## D-83 Tests are short and bounded
(Aaron, 2026-10-08.)
1. A test is kept short. A full suite that takes long to run is a defect to fix, not to wait out: a slow test is shortened, or split, when it is found.
2. Every wait in a test (a loop, a join, a poll for a file or a reply) has a deadline and fails with a message when it passes. No test can hang the run.
3. Tests don't share process-wide state: a global such as the task server acts only for the root it serves, so tests running in parallel can't see each other's.
Why: a `tasks::` run timed out because one test's global server made other tests wait forever; the whole run, not just that test, was lost.
